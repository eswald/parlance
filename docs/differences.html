    <p>Differences between <a href="syntax.html">my HTML syntax document</a> and
      <a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/dpp_syntax.rtf">David's
        official RTF syntax document</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>I have changed all instances of "AI", except those occurring in the
        phrase "Diplomacy AI Development Environment", to either "client" or
        "player", as appropriate.  After all, the most often-used client is
        not, in fact, an AI.  I have also reduced the occurrences of the
        second-person pronouns, in favor of "the client" or "the player".</li>

      <li>I have made several minor grammar changes.  These don't affect the
        semantics, but make it sound nicer.  In particular, I have changed
        the oft-misunderstood Latin abbreviations "e.g." and "i.e." to their
        English equivalents, even though David
        <a href="syntax.html#IFF">almost always</a> uses them correctly.</li>

      <li>I mention the four <a href="protocol.html#Coasts">alternate
          coasts</a> defined in the protocol.
        David has mentioned these, at separate times, as both allowed and
        disallowed; in either case, they need to be in the document to avoid
        having future map writers use their TLAs.</li>

      <li>I have included a section (o) under
        <a href="syntax.html#level0">Level 0</a>, listing the multi-game
        commands as implemented by my server.  It has been in the document for
        quite some time, but formerly commented out.  I have uncommented it
        because we have recently hashed out the details on the list, and
        David has repeatedly expressed a desire for such a system.
        <br><br>
        I formally request that this section be made official.  (It may be
        moved and/or renumbered, if you wish.)</li>

      <li>I have added an optional name and version section to
        <a href="syntax.html#OBS">the OBS command</a>.
        This was David's response to a somewhat ridiculous idea of mine.
        Currently, only my software is known to send or use that information;
        David's server currently sends HUH when the name or version are
        included, upon which my server will send the OBS without arguments.
        <br><br>
        I formally request that this modification be made official.</li>

      <li>I have noted that the map name does not imply a given starting
        position.  That question has come up at least twice on the list,
        with conflicting answers.  I have chosen this answer to avoid
        problems with recovered games after a crash.</li>

      <li>I have not added the new phrase under the
        <a href="syntax.html#AOA">AOA</a> specification, "and are for a
        unit owned by the AI sending the order," because my server accepts
        absolutely any order when AOA is specified, even those for
        non-existent or foreign units.  (That's why it needs the SET
        command.)</li>

      <li>I have specified that a client, not just a player, may send
        <a href="syntax.html#HLO">HLO</a> without arguments to request a new
        copy of the HLO message.  David's appendix B has conflicting answers
        for that.  When I first commented on the conflict, he replied that HLO
        was for finding out your power and passcode after IAM, so only players
        would need it; I disagree, because it also contains the variant rule
        information.</li>

      <li>I disagree with the phrases, <a href="syntax.html#SCO">"or <b>REJ
            (SCO)</b> if the game hasn't started,"</a> and
        <a href="syntax.html#SCO">"or <b>REJ (NOW)</b> if the game hasn't
          started,"</a> but I have not yet removed them from my document even
        though my server doesn't obey them.  Instead, it obeys an
        <a href="syntax.html#MDF">earlier statement</a>, "The AI can send the
        <b>NOW</b> and <b>SCO</b> commands to the Server to determine the
        supply centre ownership and starting positions for the variant."
        <br><br>
        I formally request that these phrases "<b>REJ (SCO)</b>" and "<b>REJ
          (NOW)</b>" be changed to "the starting <b>SCO</b> message" and "the
        starting <b>NOW</b> message", respectively.  Unfortunately, that still
        leaves us with no official way to get the starting position
        <em>after</em> the game has started.</li>
      
      <li>I have divided <a href="syntax.html#CCD">the CCD message</a> into
        three distinct message types:  One for a disconnected power, one for a
        power that failed to get orders in on time, and one for responding to
        <a href="syntax.html#SND">a SND command</a>.  The latter two cases
        merely add a second parameter to the CCD message.  I have not yet
        encountered a problem when sending these extended commands to current
        clients; the Mapper in particular works fine, if a little confusing.
        <br><br>
        I formally propose that these CCD extensions be made official.</li>
      
      <li>I have noted that the server may interpret
        <a href="syntax.html#ADM">an admin message</a> as a command, instead
        of forwarding it to other players.  This is not really official, but
        is the best way to deal with commands not in the syntax, within the
        constraints of the Mapper.</li>
      
      <li>I have added a way for the client to request
        <a href="syntax.html#SMR">the SMR command</a>, along with the game
        result.  This could be useful for a client that joins after the game
        finishes.  I also have considered adding behavior for dealing with
        clients taking over positions from clients of a different name and/or
        version.  Code for this is implemented in my server, but disabled by
        default; it is not yet documented in the syntax, though.
        <br><br>
        I formally propose that the client-to-server SMR command be made
        official.</li>
      
      <li>As with the CCD response to an attempt to send press, I have added
        a second parameter to <a href="syntax.html#OUT">the OUT message</a>,
        listing the failed press command.
        <br><br>
        I formally propose that this extension be made official.</li>
      
      <li>I have added a note about the <a href="syntax.html#PTL">PTL
          variant</a> as a reason for rejecting a SND command.</li>
      
      <li>I disagree with the inability to concede the game to a single
        player, but I accept it for now.  I would prefer that a single-player
        draw again be allowed, as a concession to that player.</li>
      
      <li>My <a href="syntax.html#appA">appendix A</a> is much more complete,
        including obsolete tokens and token numbers.</li>
      
      <li>My <a href="syntax.html#appB">appendix B</a> describes how the
        syntax has been integrated into the document as a whole, instead of
        listing the syntax itself.  As part of this, many more syntax items
        in the main text are prefixed with "label = ".</li>
      
      <li>I don't have the latest set of changes marked in underlines and
        strikeouts.  That's just me being lazy.</li>

      <li>The new document also includes a few of other wild ideas, commented
        out.  These are not meant to be official, but are included for future
        extensions.  (We <em>will</em> want most of them some day.)  Most of
        them have already been discussed on the list, and at least one is left
        over from a previous version of the document.</li>
