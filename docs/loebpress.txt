================================

(The term "diplomat" will refer to any program or LCS process which
plays a country using this protocol below.)

I will send a copy of this program (and even a copy of LCS to run it
in) to anyone who is interested. The program is finished, but it
may still have a few bugs.

Please send me your comments, and more importantly your programs.
These programs can be as stupid as you want. (For example, a program
that conducts no diplomacy and follows the civil disorder rules, or
moves randomly would be helpful in testing my Diplomat Interface.)

Competitions between diplomats will be scored on the following basis.
Any loss scores zero points, whereas a win or draw scores for each
winner a number of points equal to the ratio of the number of losers
(not counting unplayed countries) to winners. For example, winning a 7
player game is worth 6 points, and acheiving a 2-way draw in a 6
player game is worth 2 points each.

The following is a revision of the earlier protocol description
based on what I actually programmed. The meanings of the messages
destined for the GM are defined here. The meanings of messages
destined for other players are listed here only for advisorary
purposes.  Programmers may devise any such messages they chose, and
may interpret such messages as they see fit. However, the message
"TRY" should be most useful in communication between program with
differing vocabularies. It should be noted that all messages are
terminated by the end-of-line character.

Below I use the following notations:
	{arg}	optional arguments
	[arg]	repeated arguments
	( )	actual parenthesis
	a/b	either a or b		<equivalently a or b>
	<   >	comment

A certain amount of slop is cleaned up my program. But try to stick as
closely as possible to this syntax.

Lower case letters are used below to describe arguments as indicated
below: 

int = 		integer
command =	syntax described in chapter 1 destined for the GM
GM-message = 	syntax described in chapter 2 from the GM to the player

1) Commands for the GM.

	Command Syntax: SUB [( natunit/unit order) / (WVE) ]
	Meaning: I submit the following orders. In the winter, orders
can not be changed once submitted correctly. In all other seasons,
orders can be changed by repeated SUB commands until orders are
processed. The argument waive can be used in winter phases once for
each build you would like to waive. Note that this is the sole "order"
which is not preceeded by a unit designation. Note also that all
builds not used (or unusuable) must be explicitly WaiVEd in order to
avoid falling into a civil disorder situation.
	Meaning when sent to a player: Similar to XDO.
	Example: SUB ((RUS AMY WAR) BLD) (WVE) (WVE) :
build army war, and waive two other builds
	Example: SUB ((RUS FLT FIN) SUP (RUS FLT BAR) MTO STP) 
		     ((RUS FLT BAR) MTO (STP NCS)) (MOS HLD) 
moves barent sea to st pete with support from finland while moscow holds 
	Example: SUB ((ENG FLT NWY) RTO (STP NCS)) ((RUS FLT (BUL ECS)) DSB) 
retreat norway to stpete and disband bulgaria
	Replies from GM: THK for each move with MBV if correct.

	Command Syntax 1: DRW ([nation])
	Command Syntax 2a: DRW
	Command Syntax 2b: NOT(DRW)
Syntax 2 is used by default. Syntax 1 is used when playing under
"Partial Draws allowed" rules.
	Meaning: (1) Propose draw among the nations listed. (A one player
draw is a victory.) The draw will be accepted if proposed before the
next deadline by all players with at least one unit on the board
(except possibly the winner in the case of a solo-win). Programs
should assume draw was not accepted, since when a draw is accepted all
programs are terminated without warning. Suggestions for draws can be
sent to other players via the DRW command or (SND (REF) (DRW ...))
combination. Each country may only propose one victory at a time. When
a player no longer wishes to propose any draw, he should insist on a
solo victory with "DRW [himself]". 
	(2) DRW means to agree to a draw including all survivors.
NOT(DRW) means to not agree to such a draw.
	Meaning when sent to a player: I propose the following draw.
Please vote for it.
	Example: DRW (ENG TUR)

	Command Syntax: SND ([nation]) [(msg)]
	Meaning: The only way to send a message to another player is
via the GM by use of this command. This command can also be sent to
other players as a sort of suggestion. The GM does not allow this
command during seasons other than SPRING and FALL, nor under gunboat
rules. However, some messages sent in one season may occasionally
arrive during the next. When the SND command is given to the referee,
none of the recipients of the message can be "REF". Other players may
accept "REF" as a valid player. 
	Meaning when sent to a player: Please pass on the following
message. 
	Example: SND (RUS) (NOT (XDO ((RUS FLT (STP NCS)) BLD)))
	Example: SND (RUS FRA) (ALY VSS (ENG))
	GM Replies: SNT, CDD, OUT, NEC, NRS, BPR (during no diplomacy phases)

	Command Syntax: SLP
	Meaning: I do not intend to send any more output until I
receive input. (Not currently implemented, but might be useful for
detecting and resolving deadlocks.)
	Meaning when sent to a player: As above.

	Command Syntax: GOF
	Meaning: Used to raise a "GO" flag which if lowered
inhibits the processing of SPRING and FALL moves even if all the moves
are in. (This is the equivalent of SET WAIT and SET NOWAIT on the
adjudicator.) Each country has its own personal flag. The flag starts
each spring and fall season in the up position.
	The Go flag can be lower with NOT(GOF).
	Meaning when sent to a player: I have submitted all of my
moves, and I am happy with them.

	Command Syntax: LOG (msg)
	Meaning: The message is included in any possible game-record.
Programs should use the LOG command frequently for later debugging.
	The message should indicate the status of the program.

	Command Syntax: SCD, NOW, HLO, MIS
	Meaning: Asks the GM to send a new message of type SCD, NOW,
HLO, or MIS.
	Meaning when sent to a player: For SCD see below. HLO is used
to test connections, but has no meaning. MIS is similar to WHT.

Note: Do not send any null strings to the GM. The detection of null
strings eminating from your program might result in its automatic
termination.  

2) Messages from the GM.

	GM Message Syntax: HLO country [{variants}]
	Meaning: The game has just begun and you are playing
"country". The following variant rules may be in effect:
	PDA - PARTIAL DRAWS ALLOWED: Under these rules Draws may
exclude certain survivors. Otherwise, by default, draws include all
survivors. (See DRW)
	GBT - GUNBOAT: Under these rules, no negotiation is allowed.
Otherwise, by default, By  is being played by "Gunboat" rules. Thus, the
command SND is forbidden. Otherwise, negotiation is allowed prior to
movement phases only via the SND command.
	Example: HLO ENG
	Example: HLO ENG GBT PDA
	Don't Reply.

	GM Message Syntax: LOD file
	Meaning: The game is being resumed. You have saved the results
in the specified file. 
	Note: All programs should expect to receive either HLO or LOD
as one of their first inputs. However, in theory, another program
could receive its HLO and then send you a message before you have
received yours.
	Example: LOD GAME1.ENG.DUMP
	Reply with: YES(LOD file) or NOT(LOD file) depending on if you
are ready to resume the game.

	GM Message Syntax: SVE file
	Meaning: Please save the current position in the specified
file for use later with the LOD command. 
	Note: 1) Unless followed by an OFF, the game will continue.
	      2) Your program should also keep track of all messages
that were sent recently but not confirmed. Such messages may have to
be resent when the game is resumed.
	Example: SVE GAME1.ENG.DUMP
	Reply with: YES (SVE file) if save was successful and
NOT (SVE file) otherwise. 

	GM Message Syntax: CDD/OUT/NSC (country)
	Meaning: The country in question has achieved a fatal error
and is in civil disorder, or has been eliminated from the game. (Such
countries may continue to send messages, but may not receive
messages.) This reply is sent once in response to each SND command. 
	Example: CDD ENG 	England is CD
	Example: OUT FRA	France is out
	Example: NSC XYZ	XYZ is not a country
	Don't Reply.

	GM Message Syntax: TME
	Meaning: You must submit moves soon. 
	Reply With: SUB to give your remaining orders if any.

	GM Message Syntax: THK annorder
	Meaning: The following move was illegal. Or when used by a
player: I predict the following results.
	Example: THK (ENG AMY LON) MTO NWY FAR	
	Example: THK (ENG FLT HOL) CNV (ENG FLT LON) CTO NWY NAS
	Reply with: SUB with corrected order

	GM Message Syntax: ORD turn results
	Meaning: These are the results of the previous turn. If the
coming move is a movement phase, then begin diplomacizing. Otherwise,
submit moves soon, since "TME 0" will be your only warning. "Turn"
refers to the previous turn. The message ORD is sent at the end of
every turn (even turns in which nothing happened).
	Builds Waived are not listed...

	GM Message Syntax: NOW turn [ ( nation unit {MRT [prov]} ) ]
	Meaning: These are the current locations of all units. "Turn"
refers to the current or upcoming turn. The message NOW is sent after
every turn, and at the beginning of the game. The MRT indicates that
the unit in questions must retreat to one of the provinces listed. If
there are no provinces listed, then the unit must disband.

	GM Message Syntax: SCD [(nation [prov])]
	Meaning: The message SCD is sent after every AUTUMN turn and
at the beginning of the game. It indicates who is the current owner of
each supply center. Unowned supply centers are simply not listed.

	GM Message Syntax 1: MIS [natunit]
	GM Message Syntax 2: MIS [( natunit [prov] )] 
	GM Message Syntax 3: MIS int
	Meaning: Indication of orders missing. In form 1 used in
Spring and Fall, this is a list of units to order. In form 2 used in
Summer and Autumn, this is a list of units to retreat followed by a
(possibly empty) list of places they can retreat to. In form 3, a
positive number indicates the number of units left to REMOVE whereas a
negative number indicates the number of BUILDS left to use or waive.   

	GM Message Syntax: FRM nation1 {nation2} {(CCD [nation3])} [(msg)]
	Basic Meaning: The following message(s) were sent to me from
the indicated nation.
	First Argument: (Not used by GM) Message was sent by nation1
to nation2 instead of to me. 
	Second Argument: Duplicate copies of the message were received
by the nations indicated.
	Other Arguments: Each message is sent separately by the GM.
Other players may include a list of messages wrapped in parenthesis.
	Example: FRM RUS (NOT (PCE))
	Example: FRM RUS ENG (NOT (PCE))
	Reply as indicated in explation of msg.

	GM Message Syntax: (SNT nation {(msg)})
	Meaning: I have sent following messages to the indicated
nation. (Equivalent constructions are available using FRM, but may be
less believable.) The GM uses the message "after" successful delivery
of a message as a return receipt. Thus, this message can be used to
carefully regulate the order in which messages arrive somewhere.
	Example: SNT RUS (NOT (XDO ((RUS FLT (STP NCS)) BLD)))
	Don't reply.

	GM Message Syntax: HUH (msg)
	Meaning: I understood the general message sent, but not the
specific syntax. Here is the misunderstood message with an asterisk
inserted at the point up to which I understand. (The code (ERR) can be
inserted instead of an asterisk by a player.) 
Since the GM tries to clean up the messages it receives, the message
it sends back to you might not exactly correspond to the one you sent. 
	Example: HUH (DMZ BUR *ENG RUH) indicated the
nonacceptance of a nation in a list of provinces in the demilitarized
zone message.
	Reply With: A better version of the same message.

	GM Message Syntax: DOC [([nation])]
	Meaning: This message is sent at the beginning of a game with
less than the full number of players. It means that the various
countries are to play together in teams. The final result for any
member of a team is the average of the final results of all the
members of the team. Each parenthesised group of nations is a single
team. This message is not sent when every nation is playing by itself.

	GM Message Syntax: LNG int
	GM Message Syntax: EOM
	Meaning: Diplomats which request a maximum line length will
receive messages using this syntax when otherwise this maximum would
be violated. First the message (LNG int) is sent where the integer
indicates the number of lines of messages. Then the message is sent
broken into that many lines, but always broken between words. Finally,
the message EOM is sent signalling the end of the message.
	Example: LNG 6
		 NOW SUM 101 (AUS AMY BUD) (AUS AMY GAL) (AUS FLT ALB)
		 (ENG AMY WAL) (ENG FLT NTH) (ENG FLT LON) (FRA AMY MAR) 
		 (FRA AMY BUR) (FRA FLT BRE) (GER AMY KIE) (GER AMY
		 RUH)  (GER FLT DEN)  (ITA AMY APU) (ITA AMY VEN) (ITA
		 FLT ION) (RUS AMY UKR) (RUS AMY WAR) (RUS FLT BOT)
		 (TUR AMY BUL) (TUR FLT CON) (TUR AMY SMY)
		 EOM

	GM Message Syntax: NRS (message)
	Meaning: Diplomatic messages can not be sent during retreat
and build phases, or according the the gunboat rules.
	Reply Next Turn with: repeated message if still appropriate.

	GM Message Syntax: BPR (message)
	Meaning: The following message was received while results were
being calculated. Instead of proceeding with the command it is being
returned. The message can be resent next turn, or discarded as you see
fit.  
	Reply Next Turn with: repeated message if still appropriate.

	GM Message Syntax: PRN (message)
	Meaning: The following message was not processed due to bad
parenthesation. 
	Reply With: Corrected message as needed. 
	Warning: The message PRN (message) is itself badly
parenthesized, but there is no need to signal this "error". Some
messages with bad parenthesis will nevertheless be understood by the
interface, and this message will not be generated.

	GM Message Syntax: OFF 
	Meaning: Your program is being asked to terminate. Perhaps the
game is over (because of a draw), perhaps your program has gone CD, or
perhaps the game has been saved and will be resumed later, or perhaps
the game is being aborted.
	Don't reply

3) Making contact with the other countries.

	Message Syntax: TRY [{msg}]
	Meaning: I do not understand the message you sent, following
is a list of messages I can undestand. There is no point sending this
message to the GM, but the GM can use this message in response to
players. 
	Example: TRY PCE XDO
	Example: TRY used by a program which can't communicate
	Reply with: Equivalent message from message list.

	Message Syntax: PSV [{msg}]
	Meaning: Following is a list of messages I can understand
although I don't use them.   
	
	Message Syntax: ACT [{msg}]
	Meaning: Following is a list of messages I use but don't
understand. 

	Message Syntax: ALT {syntax}
	Meaning: Please use (one of) the alternate syntax/protocol
indicated. (This is for use if people create alternate conflicting
protocols.) 
	Example: ALT DPP
	Reply With: Given more than one choice of protocol reply
positively with ALT or the protocol. Given one choice reply positively
with YES or the protocol. Respond negatively with NOT(ALT syntax) or
TRY or ACT or PSV. 

	Message Syntax: RPT {(msg)}
	Meaning: Please repeat or replace message.
	Reply With: Message, or NOT(RPT...) is you are unable to do so.

	Message Syntax: YES [(msg)]
	Meaning: Yes

	Message Syntax: NOT [(msg)]
	Meaning: No

	Message Syntax: IDK {(msg)}
	Meaning: I don't know. Maybe.

	Message Syntax: BWX {(msg)}
	Meaning: No comment. None of your bee's wax. Maybe.

	Message Syntax: END
	Meaning: Offer to disconnect. Have presumably submited orders
to the GM, and unset the GO flag. Assuming a reply of YES, you intend
to set the GO flag.

	Message Syntax: MSG label (msg)
	Meaning: Please consider the indicated message, and identify
it for later reference by the indicated label. A unique label should
be generated for each such occurance of the message.
	Reply as per the indicated message.

	Message Syntax: LAB label (string)
	Meaning: Please in the future accept the label as being
synonymous with the following string.
	Reply: YES(LAB...) or NOT(LAB...)

4) Basic terminology (these messages are usually preceeded by QRY INS
or PRP. Otherwise, they could be treated as if they were preceeded by
PRP.)  

	Message Syntax: PCE {([country])}
	Meaning: A general cease fire between our forces
(unless otherwise indicated) for the rest game (unless otherwise
indicated).
	Negated meaning: Declaration of war.
	Reply With: Negatively NOT(PCE...). Positively with
YES(PCE...). Possibly to be followed by ALY or DMZ.

	Message Syntax: DMZ {(country country)} [{prov}]
	Meaning: Proclaims an unspecified demilitarized zone between
us or the 2 indicated countries for the rest of the game. The argument
defines the DMZ.  Use (NOT(XDO...)) for conditional DMZ's (eg: no
fleets, only certain coasts, etc)
	Negated Meaning: NOT(DMZ) refutes all DMZ's. NOT(DMZ provs)
refutes a particular DMZ.
	Example: DMZ BUR RUH NTH
	Example: DMZ (FRA GER) BUR RUH NTH
	Reply With: YES(DMZ...), NOT(DMZ...), or DMZ.

	Message Syntax: ALY {([nation])} {VSS ([nation])}
	Meaning: An alliance between the players indicated (or me and
you by default) versus the indicated country(ies) if any.
	Example: ALY (FRA ENG ITA) VSS (GER RUS)
	Example: ALY VSS (GER RUS)
	Example: ALY (FRA) VSS (ENG)	<=== France is at war with England
	Note: Unless prefixed by FOR, all alliances are assumed to
last until the end of the game. 

	Message Syntax:  XDO [(natunit order)]
	Meaning: He will/should make the following order(s). (Specify
a time with FOR. Otherwise, default is the earliest time such an order
might be appropriate.) Use with NOT to forbid certain orders.
	Example: XDO ((ENG FLT ECH) CNV (ENG AMY EDI) MTO WAL)
	Reply With: YES or SNT or ...
	Note: Identity of player can be deduced from unit nationality.
Moves that shouldn't or won't be done, can be indicated with NOT(XDO...)
	
	Message Syntax: EXP {turn} {[(msg)]}
	Meaning: You broke your promise(s) (indicated) which you made
just before the turn indicated. 
	Example: EXP (FAL 102) (UNO ((RUS FLT (STP NCS)) BLD))
	Reply with: SRY, NOT(EXP...) (to deny the accusation), NOT(PCE), or
YES(EXP...) (to indicate accusation is true without being sorry or
declaring war). 
	Note: Unless otherwise indicated by a FOR message. This
message applies to the most RECENT season to which it could apply. 

	Message Syntax: SRY
	Meaning: I am sorry.

	Message Syntax: SCD {[(nation [prov]/int )]} 
	Meaning: We will divide the spoils as follows. (Avoid listing
nations who won't be getting spoils.) Temporary distributions of
spoils to eliminate inequities can be assigned using FOR message.
SCD without arguments can be used to encourage other player to send a
completed SCD message. By default, the time frame in question is the
2nd autumn phase following next. SCD makes no claims about supply
centers not mentioned.
	Example: SCD (ENG BRE SPA POR) (GER BEL PAR) (ITA MAR)
	Example: SCD (ENG 3) (GER 2) (ITA 1)
	Example: SCD
	Reply With: SCD with provinces in order to reply positively to
SCD with integers. 

	Message Syntax: IOU/UOM {int}
	Message Syntax: XOY nation1 nation2 {int}
	Meaning: I owe you, or you own me, or nation1 owes nation2 a 
favor. If the integer is specified, then that indicates the size of
the favor. The default is a favor of size 100 which can be
interpretted as the "value" of a supply center. (Negative values
indicate favors going in the other direction.)

	Message Syntax: FOR turn [(msg)]
	Message Syntax: FOR {turn1}-{turn2} {(msg)}
	Meaning: The following messages refer to the turn(s)
indicated. 
	Example: FOR (WIN 103) (XDO ((RUS FLT SEV) BLD))
	Example: FOR (WIN 103)- (XDO ((RUS FLT SEV) BLD)) 
	Example: FOR -(WIN 103) (XDO ((RUS FLT SEV) BLD))
	Example: FOR (WIN 103)-(WIN 104) (XDO ((RUS FLT SEV) BLD))
	Note: Unless otherwise indicated, all messages not prefixed by
FOR apply *ONLY* to the next season for which it could logically
apply unless otherwise indicated.   

	Message Syntax: PPT {nat1 nat2} {[ XDO/SND/FRM/SCD ]} 
	Meaning: Nat1 ("I" by default) offer to become Nat2's ("your" by
default) pupppet (and will: make the move you tell me to, send the
messages you tell me to, forward all messages to you, and accept any
distribution of supply centers that you think of.) Any conditions on
the Puppetship should be placed in a FRM or IFF.
	Example: IFF (SCD (AUSTRIA VIE BUD TRI)) THN (FOR -80 (PPT
XDO SND FRM)) : If you let me (Austria) keep my home supply centers
then I will do whatever you say until the end of 1908
	Example: PPT
	Conventions: The following behavior is expected in a puppet
relationship. (1) The puppet may ask WHT for his missing orders, (2)
the master supplies orders with XDO (and messages to send with SND),
(3) the puppet obediantly submits the orders with SUB (and messages
with SND), (4) any resulting error messages are reported to the master
using THK followed possibly by another WHT message, (5) if the TME
signal is sent and no orders have yet been received or if the master
is eliminated or becomes CD, then the puppet choses orders as best he
can. (The puppet may flag NGO in order to wait as long as possible.)
Applies to the rest of the game by default.

	Message Syntax: command 	(other than NOW and LOG)
	Meaning: I urge you to send the following command to the GM.
Exact meanings are listed in chapter 1.

5) Complex messages

	Message Syntax: QRY (message)
	Meaning: Is the following message true.	
	Example: QRY (ALY (ENG FRA) VSS (GER ITA)) 
	Reply with: YES(QRY...), NOT(QRY...), IDK, BWX 

	Message Syntax: INS (message)
	Meaning: I insist of the truth of the following message.
	Example: STR (UNO ((ENG FLT LON) MTO ECH))

	Message Syntax: PRP (message)
	Message: I propose the following message.
	
	Message Syntax: NOT (message)
	Message: I propose that the negation of the following message.

	Message Syntax: REJ (message)
	Message: I reject the truth of the following message.

	Message Syntax: IFF (m1) THN (m2) {ELS (m3)}
	Meaning: If you m1 [probably XDO] then I will m2
or else I will m3. (For really funky messages, you can include the
arguments AND ORR and NOT in m1.)
	Example: IFF (FOR 15 (XDO ((RUS FLT (STP NCS)) BLD))) THN 
(FOR 16 (XDO ((RUS AMY SWE) SUP (ENG FLT (STP NCS)) MTO NWY))) ELS
(NOT(PCE))) : If you build F Stp(nc) in winter 1903 then I will
I will support you in Spring 1904 to Norway, otherwise I will declare war.

	Message Syntax: WHT {[natunit]}
	Meaning: Suggest a(nother) move for the indicated unit (or all
my units). In the case of his units, then this is a demand to know
what these units will be ordered to do.
	Example: WHT (ENG FLT NTH)
	Reply with: Negatively with BWX. Positively with XDO or XDO,
and use WHT for the remaining units. (Try to make forward progress
with these suggestions in order to avoid infinite loops.)
	Note: This message is used by two (or more) allies to create a
plan of attack. Some players might take offense if it used at the
BEGINNING of a negotiation. Use QRY (XDO...) or MIS... instead.

	Message Syntax: HOW natunit/prov/country 
	Meaning: Suggest a plan of attack
	Example: HOW MOS		
	Reply with: XDO or NOT(XDO...), or NOT(HOW...) if you don't
think it is a good idea and THK to give the reason.
	
	Message Syntax: CTE rule
	Meaning: I cite rule (by rulenumber) which you may have
overlooked.
	Example: CTE IX.3	(you can't dislodge your own unit)
