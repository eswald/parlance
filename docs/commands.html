    <h1>PyDip Diplomacy Server - Admin Commands</h1>

    <p>To use any of these commands, either begin an admin message with
      "Server:" or type the whole command in capital letters.  If the first
      form is entered correctly, the command itself will <em>never</em> be
      returned or forwarded like a usual admin message; instead, there will
      always be a message from the server.  If the command is in all caps,
      however, it will be forwarded if admin commands are disabled.</p>


    <h2>Information Commands</h2>
    <p>These commands simply list information about the server.  Other players
      won't even know that you entered them.</p>

    <h3><a name="help">Help</a></h3>
    <p>Lists the admin commands accepted by the server, with a brief
      description of each.</p>

    <h3><a name="list_variants">List Variants</a></h3>
    <p>Lists the variant names accepted by the <a href="#new_variant_game">New
        <em>&lt;variant&gt;</em> Game</a> command.</p>

    <h3><a name="list_bots">List Bots</a></h3>
    <p>Lists the types of bot that can be started with the
      <a href="#start_bot">Start <em>&lt;bot&gt;</em></a> commands, with a
      short description of each.  <strong>Note:</strong> You may also start
      bots on your own machine, pointing them to this server.</p>

    <h3><a name="list_players">List Players</a></h3>
    <p>Lists the names of the players connected to your current game, and the
      number of observers.  <strong>Note:</strong> Their power assignments will
      <em>not</em> be listed.</p>

    <h3><a name="who">Who</a></h3>
    <p>Synonym for <a href="#list_players">List Players</a>.</p>

    <h3><a name="status">Status</a></h3>
    <p>Displays the status of each game currently hosted by the server.</p>


    <h2>Vetoable Commands</h2>
    <p>These commands modify the game state.  After one of these commands is
      issued, any player or observer in the affected game can
      <a href="#veto">veto</a> it within twenty seconds to completely block
      and/or reverse its effects.  In most cases, this means the command is
      not actually carried out until that time expires.</p>

    <h3><a name="resume">Resume</a></h3>
    <p>Reverses the effects of the <a href="#pause">Pause</a> command.  The
      deadline timer (if any) starts with the same amount of time it had when
      the game was paused, and the phase will end if all players have
      submitted orders.  <strong>Note:</strong> If the game was paused because
      one or more players disconnected, this <em>will</em> resume it before
      they reconnect.</p>
    <p>The server may also attempt to resume the game when players reconnect.
      Currently, this does not depend on whether the game was paused
      automatically or manually; this behavior may change.</p>

    <h3><a name="start_bot">Start <em>&lt;number&gt;</em>
        <em>&lt;bot&gt;</em></a></h3>
    <p>Invites one or more copies of a bot player into the game.  For example,
      "Start a Dumbbot" will create one imitation copy of David's DumbBot.
      "Start evilbots" will start as many cheaters as it takes to fill up the
      game.  "Start 2 HoldBots" will do exactly that.  Bots started in this way
      will connect to your current game, even if another one has been
      started.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This currently requires at least two different
      players to be connected to the game.  If you wish to play a solo game on
      this server, use your own bots.</p>

    <h3><a name="start_bot_as">Start <em>&lt;bot&gt;</em> as
        <em>&lt;power&gt;</em></a></h3>
    <p>As <a href="#start_bot">above</a>, but you get to choose the power that
      the bot will play.  The chosen power may not be that of a currently
      connected player, but this command works before the game starts or after
      a player disconnects.</p>

    <h3><a name="eject">Eject <em>&lt;player&gt;</em></a></h3>
    <p>Forcibly removes a player from the game.  You can specify
      <em>&lt;player&gt;</em> as either a player's name (usually the same as in
      their admin messages) or their country (full name or three-letter
      abbreviation).</p>

    <p>If multiple players share the name (usually because they're all bots),
      they will all be ejected unless the game has already started.  After the
      game starts, eject them one by one, using their country names.  Observers
      cannot (yet) be ejected from a game.</p>

    <h3><a name="boot">Boot <em>&lt;player&gt;</em></a></h3>
    <p>A stronger form of <a href="#eject">Eject</a>.  The player(s) being
      booted cannot veto this command, but other players and observers can.</p>

    <h3><a name="end_game">End Game</a></h3>
    <p>Ends the game, without declaring a winner or a draw.  However, if the
      game has been started, a <a href="syntax.html#SMR">summary
        message</a> is sent.</p>


    <h2>Non-Vetoable Commands</h2>
    <p>These commands, for various reasons, cannot be vetoed, even though they
      affect the game state.  Their effects will generally be reported to all
      players and observers in your current game.</p>

    <h3><a name="veto">Veto</a></h3>
    <p>Cancels any vetoable commands for the current game.  Another word may be
      added to restrict the type of command vetoed; for example, "veto end"
      would only veto <a href="#end_game">End Game</a> commands.</p>

    <h3><a name="cancel">Cancel</a></h3>
    <p>Synonym for <a href="#veto">Veto</a>.  May in the future be restricted
      to canceling only actions that you initiated.</p>

    <h3><a name="reject">Reject</a></h3>
    <p>Synonym for <a href="#veto">Veto</a>.  The Maginot version of this
      command seems to only veto pause commands.</p>

    <h3><a name="enable_press">Enable Press</a></h3>
    <p>Sets the press level to 8000 (Free Text).  <strong>Note:</strong>
      Enable/disable press commands can only be used <em>before</em> the game
      starts, so the server can send the correct syntax level to the
      players.</p>

    <h3><a name="enable_press_level">Enable Press Level
        <em>&lt;N&gt;</em></a></h3>
    <p>Sets the press level to level <em>&lt;N&gt;</em>.  <em>&lt;N&gt;</em>
      must be either the number or the name of a level listed in <a
          href="syntax.html">the message syntax document</a>; for example,
      "Enable press level 30" and "Enable press level Multipart Offers" are
      equivalent.  Abbreviations and alternate spellings are not allowed,
      nor are intermediate numeric levels.</p>

    <h3><a name="disable_press">Disable Press</a></h3>
    <p>Sets the press level to 0 (no press).  This has the side effect of
      disabling noDIAS draws, even if the PDA flag has already been sent in
      HLO messages.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="time_limits"><em>&lt;phase&gt;</em> Time Limit
        [<em>&lt;seconds&gt;</em>]</a></h3>
    <p>Sets the time limit for <em>&lt;phase&gt;</em> (move, build, retreat,
      or press) to <em>&lt;seconds&gt;</em>.  If <em>&lt;seconds&gt;</em> is
      omitted or the game has already started, instead reports the current
      time limit.</p>

    <h3><a name="pause">Pause</a></h3>
    <p>Stops the current deadline timer, if any.  Also prevents the judge from
      adjudicating any phases, until the next <a href="#resume">Resume</a>
      command (which may be sent automatically).</p>

    <h3><a name="new_game">New Game</a></h3>
    <p>Begins a new game, with the standard map.  You will stay connected to
      the current game, and it will keep running as normal; however, no new
      players or observers, except server-started bots and SEL-aware clients,
      can connect to it until the new game finishes.</p>

    <h3><a name="new_variant_game">New <em>&lt;variant&gt;</em> Game</a></h3>
    <p>Begins a new game, with the <em>&lt;variant&gt;</em> map.  Otherwise,
      the same as the <a href="#new_game">New Game</a> command.  The
      <em>&lt;variant&gt;</em> must be specified by its DAIDE name, as listed
      on <a href='variants.html'>the map variant page</a>.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="new_game_name">New Game <em>&lt;name&gt;</em></a></h3>
    <p>Begins a new game, using <em>&lt;name&gt;</em> as its identifier.
      Otherwise, the same as the <a href="#new_game">New Game</a> command.
      The <em>&lt;name&gt;</em> may only include letters, numbers, and
      underscores, and will be converted to upper case.</p>
