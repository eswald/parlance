    <h1>PyDip Todo List</h1>
    <p>These are items that I want to add to the PyDip package, in my
      <a name='http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/copious-free-time.html'>copious
        free time</a>, listed in no particular order.</p>

    <h2>Scorekeeping</h2>
    <p>The server should probably keep and publish statistics on games played.
      Some sort of verification system would be in order, to ensure that
      nobody is misrepresented.  This might be handled through a "Server:
      register" command, or similar.  I don't really expect many bots to
      verify themselves, though.</p>
    <p>The server should make its move logs available for perusal.</p>
    <p>A <code>playback</code> admin command could be in order, sending one
      turn per second.  That could also be done client-side, but the Mapper
      doesn't have such a function yet.</p>

    <h2>Delayed Order Processing</h2>
    <p>The <a href='http://www.floc.net/dpjudge/?page=About'>DPjudge</a>
      processes moves only every twenty minutes, giving the last player to
      submit orders a little bit of time to revise them and/or set wait.
      In this case, I would want to delay order processing by a configurable
      amount, probably defaulting to zero.</p>
    
    <h2>Rule Variants</h2>
    <p>Rule variants are extremely tricky, both because they require extra
      coding in the Judge, and because the syntax doesn't support them at all.
      However, I would like to support the Loeb9 map, wing units, crystal ball,
      payola, and other variants, if there is any interest.</p>

    <h2>PeaceBot</h2>
    <p>PeaceBot is excessively limited at the moment.  Ideally, it should
      assign one ally to do all the tactical processing each turn, through XDO
      and YDO.  It should also detect stabs.</p>
    
    <h2>ComboBot</h2>
    <p>The first tactical engine of my own design has failed due to speed
      issues.  Perhaps it would help if I started by looking at the most
      valuable provinces that could be influenced.</p>
    
    <h2>MapChatty</h2>
    <p>This needs a way to display orders and redraw the screen.  That would
      probably be best as a set of panels that could be toggled through
      irc-style /commands.  A summary panel would be good, too; disconnection
      messages tend to push it under the map.</p>
    <p>It would be nice if the input line used the <code>readline</code>
      interface, with history.  It would also be nice to have keys to scroll
      the admin line display.  Do these conflict?</p>
    <p>Eventually, this thing should allow me to play a game, not just
      watch.</p>
    
    <h2>External clients</h2>
    <p>I would like the ability to call external commands as bots, using an
      <code>[external]</code> section of the config file.  Python 2.4's
      <code>subprocess</code> module would probably be helpful here.</p>
    
    <h2>Internal clients</h2>
    <p>Bots started from the server could be optimized a bit.  This would
      probably start with the socket.socketpair() call, new in Python 2.4,
      but may extend to avoiding the network layer altogether.</p>
    
    <h2>Comments and code style</h2>
    <p>I need to go through the code and verify each comment and docstring.
      While I'm at it, I should use a consistent code style, probably based on
      <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a>; in
      particular, decide whether "and" and "or" go at the end or beginning of
      a line, and whether to put space around parentheses in DAIDE-like
      expressions.</p>
    <p>I should also update to Python 2.4 syntax for sorted and reversed lists,
      generator expressions, and parenthetical import statements.</p>
    
    <h2>DATC Options</h2>
    <p>I should test David's server for its response to the DATC options; for
      that matter, I should verify that it passes the normal tests.  Again,
      the <code>subprocess</code> module may be useful here.</p>
    <p>Various tests have yet to be written, and many options have yet to be
      supported.  The comments in the config file should also reflect the lack
      of support for various options.</p>
    
    <h2>Refactoring</h2>
    <p>The various bot modules should be in a subdirectory, as should the test
      modules.  Unfortunately, this requires either Python 2.5's relative
      import syntax, or package installation.</p>
    <p>The validation and startup code should probably be optimized a bit
      more, particularly near regular expressions.</p>
    <p>Project20M also needs some refactoring for thread-safety, option
      configuration, and global variable reduction.</p>
    <p>Token.opts should be removed entirely, and the init_language call moved
      to the language module.</p>
    <p>StringToken and IntegerToken seem half-complete right now, because
      Token can theoretically be called directly in their case.  Either
      separate them completely (which could help with <code>value()</code>,
      <code>is_text()</code>, and so forth), or merge them back.  Probably the
      former, because the Message class calls them directly.</p>
    <p>Game and Historian should be restructured into a weak reference
      wrapper, particularly if other clients start using LST and SEL.</p>
    
    <h2>User Interface</h2>
    <p>Some modules could give explanatory messages instead of doing nothing
      when run as a script.</p>
    <p>The command-line interface could use some serious option parsing,
      probably tying into the config options.</p>
    <p>Output might be better run through the <code>logger</code> package.</p>
    <p>Graphics would probably be a good idea.  Particularly a map.</p>
    
    <h2>Network Interface</h2>
    <p>It might be nice if a client kept trying to connect until it gets
      through or the user gets bored.  Maybe.</p>
    <p>Disconnecting a client when its network buffer clogs up is probably not
      the best way to go about it.  Then again, it might have received a
      chopped message anyway, and should be processing messages faster.</p>
    
    <h2>Standards Compliance</h2>
    <p>My <a href="docs/syntax.html#HLO">DSD</a> behavior differs slightly
      from the syntax document.  I should check whether orders are due,
      instead of whether the power has been eliminated.  Then again, the
      document doesn't specify what happens to the deadline for the next
      phase...</p>
    <p>In addition, DSD-started pauses are now treated exactly like
      admin-command pauses.  When all players reconnect, either one will
      trigger a server-generated vetoable resume command.  However, this
      can cause a delay, where the official behavior specifies none.</p>
    <p>Time messages can currently send or accept negative times, meaning
      hours.  This is not official.  Better would be to have an optional
      second parameter for the hours, so the time can still be accurate to the
      second.</p>
    
    <h2>Premature Draws</h2>
    <p>The Judge can declare a draw after a certain number of static
      years, which it defines as years in which no supply center counts change.
      Should that instead be years in which no supply center changes hands?</p>
    
    <h2>Resource cleanup</h2>
    <p>Something is failing to close the port properly in the test_timeout
      unit test.</p>
    <p>Everything that interacts with files should be wrapped in try...finally
      blocks to close the file properly.</p>
    <p>I might want to create the game log directory before writing into it;
      currently, game logging simply fails and the game stays in memory.</p>
    <p>Could I possibly parse the variant file lazily?</p>
    
    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
    <p>The remaining doctests should probably be refactored into proper
      unittest modules.</p>
    <p>The DATC options in 4.D and 4.E could use some actual tests.</p>
    <p>THX order notes could use more testing.</p>
