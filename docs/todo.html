      Diplomacy software package.">

    <h1>Parlance Todo List</h1>
    <p>These are items that I want to add to the Parlance package, in my
      <a name='http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/copious-free-time.html'>copious
        free time</a>, listed in no particular order.</p>
    
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>The software needs more package-level documentation, particularly
      detailed usage notes.  Consider the pudge command of pbu.</p>
    <p>Potential bot writers in particular need a lot more help than I
      currently give them.  Perhaps a template bot file, with all sorts of
      extra information.</p>
    <p>The LST and SEL commands need examples.  In particular, it must be made
      clear that neither one is necessary for connection.</p>
    <p>A new form of IAM has been proposed, appending (name) and (version).</p>
    <p>SLO has been proposed as the player command to concede to a solo.</p>

    <h2>Scorekeeping</h2>
    <p>The server should probably keep and publish statistics on games played.
      Some sort of verification system would be in order, to ensure that
      nobody is misrepresented.  This might be handled through a "Server:
      register" command, or similar.  I don't really expect many bots to
      verify themselves, though.</p>
    <p>The server should make its move logs available for perusal.</p>
    <p>For that matter, the server could serve dynamic web pages on the same
      port, triggering off the first four characters.  The command reference
      would be a good start, then other documentation, then the game logs.</p>
    <p>Games should each have an open game log file, writing all broadcasts to
      it with timestamps.  This should be more robust, particularly in the
      face of crashes, than the current log-on-exit idea.  Alternatively,
      log straight to a database, defaulting to sqlite in memory.</p>
    <p>A <code>playback</code> admin command could be in order, sending one
      turn per second.  That could also be done client-side, but the Mapper
      doesn't have such a function yet.</p>

    <h2>Delayed Order Processing</h2>
    <p>The <a href='http://www.floc.net/dpjudge/?page=About'>DPjudge</a>
      processes moves only every twenty minutes, giving the last player to
      submit orders a little bit of time to revise them and/or set wait.
      In this case, I would want to delay order processing by a configurable
      amount, probably defaulting to zero.</p>
    
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>Rule variants are extremely tricky, both because they require extra
      coding in the Judge, and because the syntax doesn't support them at all.
      However, I would like to support the Loeb9 map, wing units, crystal ball,
      payola, and other variants, if there is any interest.</p>
    <p>The [seasons] portion of the Abstraction II map could be implemented,
      but the Mapper might not take to kindly to that...</p>
    <p>Nessie should be relatively easy...</p>
    <p>Chaos should come soon.  It and Hundred3* should implement the
      alternate algorithm for default removals, though.</p>
    <p>Can I automatically import other nJudge maps somehow?</p>
    
    <h2>External clients</h2>
    <p>I would like the ability to call external commands as bots.  This could
      use an <code>[external]</code> section of the config file, but even
      better would be a new bot class catering specifically to each known bot.
      Such a class could be smart about using the power, passcode, and game_id
      arguments.  Python 2.4's <code>subprocess</code> module would probably
      be helpful here.</p>
    
    <h2>Internal clients</h2>
    <p>Bots started from the server could be optimized a bit.  This would
      probably start with the socket.socketpair() call, new in Python 2.4,
      but may extend to avoiding the network layer altogether.</p>
    <p>Players should be allowed to start bots to replace themselves.</p>
    <p>Bots should probably use the same database as the game server, instead
      of logging to files or relying on memory.</p>
    
    <h3>PeaceBot</h3>
    <p>PeaceBot is excessively limited at the moment.  Ideally, it should
      assign one ally to do all the tactical processing each turn, through XDO
      and YDO.  It should also detect stabs.</p>
    
    <h3>ComboBot</h3>
    <p>The first tactical engine of my own design has failed due to speed
      issues.  Perhaps it would help if I started by looking at the most
      valuable provinces that could be influenced.</p>
    <p>Betweenness values could be useful, particularly pre-calculated, in
      determining what to attack.</p>
    <p>An influence map might also help significantly to select goals.</p>
    
    <h3>MapChatty</h3>
    <p>This needs a way to display orders and redraw the screen.  That would
      probably be best as a set of panels that could be toggled through
      irc-style /commands.  A summary panel would be good, too; disconnection
      messages tend to push it under the map.</p>
    <p>It would be nice if the input line used the <code>readline</code>
      interface, with history.  It would also be nice to have keys to scroll
      the admin line display.  Do these conflict?</p>
    <p>Eventually, this thing should allow me to play a game, not just
      watch.</p>
    
    <h2>Comments and code style</h2>
    <p>I need to go through the code and verify each comment and docstring.
      __init__() docstrings should all document the variables they create.
      While I'm at it, I should use a consistent code style, probably based on
      <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a>; in
      particular, decide whether "and" and "or" go at the end or beginning of
      a line, and whether to put space around parentheses in DAIDE-like
      expressions.</p>
    <p>Docstrings in particular should be switched to the newer form, instead
      of having an extra space at the beginning of the first line.</p>
    <p>Mac OS X ships with Python 2.2; as nice as the 2.4 syntax is, I want
      Mac users to be able to run this out of the box (so to speak).
      Then again, newer Macs probably have newer Python versions.</p>
    <p>Consider "Location" ("loc") instead of Coast.  It would also be good in
      place of "province" in the syntax document where the latter could be
      (province coast).</p>
    
    <h2>DATC Options</h2>
    <p>Various tests have yet to be written, and many options have yet to be
      supported.  The comments in the config file should also reflect the lack
      of support for various options.</p>
    <p>Some options could use HLO parameter support.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the syntax should allow any loose order in a support clause.
      Or at least any loose movement order.</p>
    
    <h2>Refactoring</h2>
    <p>The validation and startup code should probably be optimized a bit
      more, particularly near regular expressions.  tokenize module?</p>
    <p>Project20M also needs some refactoring for thread-safety, option
      configuration, and global variable reduction.</p>
    <p>StringToken and IntegerToken seem half-complete right now, because
      Token can theoretically be called directly in their case.  Either
      separate them completely (which could help with <code>value()</code>,
      <code>is_text()</code>, and so forth), or merge them back.  Probably the
      former, because the Message class calls them directly.</p>
    <p>Game and Historian should be restructured into a weak reference
      wrapper, particularly if other clients start using LST and SEL.</p>
    <p>Messages could be immutable.  The constructor should also only take one
      argument, a series.  For that matter, calling a token on a series should
      be revised; try HLO(ENG)(1234)((LVL, 20)), for example.  Finally,
      consider changing __repr__() to use token-calling conventions.</p>
    <p>Judge.turn should be a property.</p>
    <p>Consider the utility of the NetworkX module, particularly for drawing
      unknown maps.</p>
    
    <h2>Robustness</h2>
    <p>The validator's greedy checking seems to cause problems with PRN
      messages.  The current workarounds seem to solve the problem, though.
      Should I let it attempt less greedy matches, though?</p>
    <p>Major problems can occur when a syntax item lists itself as the first
      non-optional item.  I seem to have eliminated all such cases from the
      syntax document, but perhaps I should create a check in the code for
      this case.</p>
    <p>There seem to be some memory leaks that cause problems when running the
      entire test suite on an old machine.</p>
    
    <h2>User Interface</h2>
    <p>Output might be better run through the <code>logger</code> package.</p>
    <p>Warnings should be run through the <code>warnings</code> package.</p>
    <p>Bot developers are requesting a real-time display of all press in the
      game, which would have to be done server-side.</p>
    <p>The standard input loop needs to be tested on Windows, where select()
      throws a fit when fed a non-socket file descriptor.  It should work as a
      thread, but not quite as well; consider running it through a socket pair
      for the original behavior.</p>
    <p>Consider a <a href="http://jtauber.com/blog/2008/11/07/voronoi_diagrams/">Voronoi diagram</a>
      to check correctness of a point-based map.</p>
    <p>Improve the game naming algorithm.  Would lower-case be better?</p>
    <p>The time limit admin command could use a better help line, and maybe a
      better interface.  Perhaps a "time limits" command should show all.</p>
    
    <h2>Network Interface</h2>
    <p>It might be nice if a client kept trying to connect until it gets
      through or the user gets bored.  Maybe.</p>
    <p>Disconnecting a client when its network buffer clogs up is probably not
      the best way to go about it.  Then again, it might have received a
      chopped message anyway, and should be processing messages faster.
      Instead, we should be buffering input, like Twisted does.  Consider
      using <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/08/29/co-routines-as-an-alternative-to-state-machines/">co-routines</a>.
      Buffer output, too.</p>
    <p>A JSON-based HTTP interface with long polling would be nice.  The
      Server should see something that looks like a Service, while the client
      should be sending and receiving DPP-like JSON objects, if possible.</p>
    
    <h2>Human-oriented Options</h2>
    <p>Players would like the ability to connect and disconnect throughout the
      day, with the server collecting press for them and delivering it in a
      bundle on connect.  Perhaps even emailing it, as well.</p>
    <p>In such games, players would like the ability to specify a backup bot
      for them, which would play one turn (without press) if they miss a
      deadline.</p>
    <p>Consider other systems of calculating the next deadline, such as the
      next of a set of times that is at least a certain amount of time
      away.</p>
    
    <h2>Standards Compliance</h2>
    <p>My <a href="syntax.html#DSD">DSD</a> behavior differs slightly
      from the syntax document.  I should check whether orders are due,
      instead of whether the power has been eliminated.  Then again, the
      document doesn't specify what happens to the deadline for the next
      phase...</p>
    <p>In addition, DSD-started pauses are now treated exactly like
      admin-command pauses.  When all players reconnect, either one will
      trigger a server-generated vetoable resume command.  However, this
      can cause a delay, where the official behavior specifies none.</p>
    <p>Time messages can currently accept negative times, meaning hours.
      This is not official.  For that matter, sending hours as an additional
      parameter isn't yet official either, nor is it well documented.</p>
    <p>My <a href="HST">HST</a> behavior may differ slightly from the
      standard.  Double-check that sometime.  Note that there doesn't seem to
      be an official way to get the starting NOW and SCO messages after the
      game has started; it would probably be best to re-purpose the HST
      message without arguments to serve that need.</a>
    <p>I allow players to cancel movement orders with NOT (SUB).  That is not
      technically allowed by the syntax document, but neither is it
      technically disallowed.</p>
    <p>I want to stop sending redundant MAP commands.  That behavior would
      differ from spec, but not in a bad way.  On the other hand, I really
      should verify that my duplicate MAP handling doesn't create an entirely
      new map.</p>
    <p>Allow a configuration setting to select negative integers for time
      limits, instead of always using the two-token system.</p>
    <p>Allow the configuration file to use natural-language times for time
      limits, such as "3 minutes" or "1:20:00" (hours:minutes:seconds).</p>
    <p>The server should be sending REJ if a player sends press to itself.</p>
    <p>It looks like NOW and SCO before a YES (MAP) should return the
      <em>starting</em> position, not the <em>current</em> position.</p>
    <p>Draws should be checked sooner.  Probably not while NOT (GOF) is set,
      but sooner than the end of the phase.</p>
    
    <h2>Premature Draws</h2>
    <p>The Judge can declare a draw after a certain number of static
      years, which it defines as years in which no supply center counts change.
      Should that instead be years in which no supply center changes hands?</p>
    
    <h2>Resource cleanup</h2>
    <p>Something is failing to close the port properly in the test_timeout
      unit test.</p>
    <p>Everything that interacts with files should be wrapped in try...finally
      blocks (or 2.5 with blocks) to close the file properly.</p>
    <p>I might want to create the game log directory before writing into it;
      currently, game logging simply fails and the game stays in memory.
      On the other hand, logging to a database would be even better.</p>
    <p>When the server shuts down, it should save a list of bots to restart.
      SAV/LOD may be helpful for state, but it would probably be better to
      give them the game name, power, and passcode, letting them load any
      saved state on their own.  OFF is plenty of warning, right?</p>
    
    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
    <p>Just give up on unittest, and switch to nose.  This would allow
      generative tests, particularly for checking every combination of DATC
      options.  Skipping would also be nice, in certain cases.</p>
    <p>The DATC options in 4.D and 4.E could use some actual tests.</p>
    <p>The network tests could use better assertions for some tests.</p>
    <p>THX order notes and ORD results could use more testing.</p>
    <p>Test the ability to serve variants with a different map name.</p>
    <p>Bot and variant test suites could be fleshed out some more.
      For example, HoldBot's actual orders could be tested.
      Variant tests should check that each key in various sections
      is actually a province or power, and that all exist if any do.</p>
    
    <h2>Open Questions</h2>
    <p>In the MDF supply_centres, is it more important that powers not be
      duplicated or that centres not be duplicated?</p>
    <p>At syntax level 30, are NOT (AND ...) and NOT (ORR ...) allowed?</p>
    <p>If a client connects after a game has started, do NOW and SCO sent
      before YES (MAP) really request the starting positions, or the current
      positions?</p>
