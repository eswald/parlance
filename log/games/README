This directory is intended for game logs.

When the [server] option log_games is on, this is the default directory for
saving game logs.  Each log will be an eight-character file with a '.dpp'
extension, consisting of a list of messages, one message per line.  This
format may change in the future, to include a time for each message, and
perhaps the press logs.

You may also store your own game logs here, if desired.
